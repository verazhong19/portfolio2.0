CozyLiving is a speculative design project aimed at brining awareness to NYC’s escalating rent. We performed research on the NYC housing market to create a gigamap as a visualization and analysis of the housing market as a system. Based on our research   findings, we proposed a speculated future and developed an immersive experience as a solution.<br>
CozyLiving is a fictional rental company that offers low cost living spaces as a solution to a hypothetical collapsed future drawing inspiration from today’s pod hotels in Japan, cage homes from Hong Kong, and goshiwons in Korea.<br><hr><br>

### Research

In order to approach this housing issue, our group started with creating a mind map in order to locate the problems that need to be tackled. This allowed us to pinpoint bigger, more evident issues and discover the subsections that exacerbate them. We created multiple mess maps and built on top of each iterations. After creating our final version, we discovered all positive loops that indicates an issue within the housing system.

<br>
Based on our research, we determined the top three factors that contributed to the unaffordable housing issue. We found these factors through identifying positive and negative feedback loops in our mess maps.

### Gigamap

From the issues we found within the system, a metaphorical representation of that system would help makes it easier to understand the NYC housing market as a supermarket. The aisle represent the housing options available, pharmacy as other essential expenses, cashiers as landlords, shoppers as renters, etc.

### User Flow
Upon deciding on the experience we will develop for our final deliverable, we defined our user flow for the website.

### Wireframe
For our wireframe we decided to create an iteration of other apartment rental website but with some new futuristic features. We have decided to add a “Scan your ID card” elements, so user can scan their IDs rather than typing it. We also included some 3D elements to the website so that it creates the illusion of a virtual visit of the apartment.

### Personas

We utilized two personas to be represented as users in our project. Manny is a lower-income man who works at LABO, a local supermarket. He has a clean rental history and is on good terms with his landlord. Andy is a higher-income woman who works at Doogle, a prestigious tech company. She has a clean rental history, however she regularly gets noise complaints from her neighbors due to her dog constantly barking. Andy and her landlord has had some conflicts due to her dog damaging the property.

### Prototype
We adopted a dark UI design style. Although the future we are describing is unfavorable and the living experience in such pods is unpleasant, we portrayed the website as a comfortable and attractive one. When users read carefully on the website's content, they will feel a huge contrast between the optimistic visual style and the unpleasant reality.
