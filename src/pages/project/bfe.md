Bridges for Enterprise is a non-prof it organization that of fers pro-bono advisory services to social impact startups based in developing nations, run by a global community of purpose-driven professionals and students. BfE operates five student-run chapters in Cambridge, New York, Singapore, Vancouver, and Rotterdam and servicing startups in over 30 countries.<br>
We executed a complete website redesign as well as developed a comprehensive branding guideline document in order to standardize creative components used by the organization including the website, social media posts, and document templates..<br><hr><br>

### Research

In order to begin rebuilding the website, we conducted research on the current website by running focus groups with leadership from different departments of the organization in order to assess the needs and information desired to convey from different perspectives. We found that main complaints regarding the site included dullness , poorly organized information, and a lack of emphasis on our organizationâ€™s global nature.

### Branding
We overhauled the entire design guidelines, as previously there was very little consistency between dif ferent official documents. We developed a brand new logo, retaining the same bridge design but aimed to look more sleek. We also standardized our typography in order to maintain consistency. The colors we selected are blues as to showcase the global and professioinal aspects of our services. We chose a yellow accent in order to bring contrast on certain elements.

### Final Website

Our final website was built using Wordpress in order to update information by our non-technical team members. The main landing page features an interactive globe that built in D3.js and implemented as a Wordpress plugin. It is used to emphasize our global presence as well as showcase our five global chapters and selected startups that we have worked with.
