10.12 Studio provides creative services to small and medium sized companies in the fashion and music industry. Services include product design, 3D animation, and branding.<br><hr><br>

### Moodboard
To showcase the branding of our studio’s work, we decided to have dark and edgy, yet minimalist aesthetic with accents of bright colors taken inspiration from streetwear fashion, abstract art, and EDM music.

### Branding
Based on our moodboard, we developed our branding guidelines based on our core aesthetic and mission, straddling the line between light and dark, colorful and monochromatic, childlike and grownup, etc.

### Prototype
We utilized a dark UI design style following our generally monochromatic color scheme. We also attempted an  horizontal scrolling experience for our work page to showcase our choice of unconventional design methodology.<br>
