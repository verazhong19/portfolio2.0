CoFind is a mobile application focused on professional networking utilizing UX components of dating apps in order to create a more personal and intimate experience in online networking. This was created in fulfillment of the Interactive Media and Business capstone project requirement. <br><hr><br>

### Background
Often the statement "It's not what you know, it's who you know" is thrown around when trying to search for jobs, starting a business, or finding new opportunities. I personally have some qualms with this statement, but it does bring up the point that professional networking is a valuable skill that can carry you a long way in your career. <br><br>
Often networking is tied to in-person activities such as conferences, coffee chats, events, etc. With unexpected situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, much of these in-person activities are disrupted and must be shifted towards an online format. <br><br>
Currently, there is only one main social media platform tailored to professional relationships, LinkedIn. LinkedIn is great, in its own right. It does a great job at maintaining a contact point for people you already know, job searching platform, and professional courses. However, it's quite difficult to actually establish new relationships via LinkedIn. LinkedIn has a heavy emphasis on connecting with people that have mutual connections, and a random connection with someone does not create an accessible memory point to estabilsh a relationship with the other person.<br><br>
Dating apps, on the other hand, are great at establishing new relationships between strangers. You can very easily meet someone on a dating app and have an intimate conversation all without meeting this person in real life. I wanted to explore the characteristics of dating apps and how they appeal to human connection and apply those characteristics to professional networking.

### Research
I tested out several social apps spanning accross different use cases. Specifically, I looked into Instagram, TikTok, Tinder, and LinkedIn. The key factor I was looking into was mainly the engagement points of each app. There were several key points I found after breaking down the user flow of each app. Instagram, TikTok, and Tinder all utilize new content as an engagement point. Based on the user flow charts, there are loops that are created through new content being pushed towards the user that entices them to engage and re-engage with new content. Meanwhile, LinkedIn is more focused on mutuality as an engagement point, so often your newfeed is filled with familiar people rather than new content.

<br>
A commonality between Tinder and TikTok is that when the app is launched, the user is immediately faced with unfamiliar content, unlinke Instagram or LinkedIn where your news feed is based on who you follow. Considering the market size, there is an indication that a large user pool for fresh content is possible.

### Persona
Based on user interviews, I have come up with three personas representing three different types of users that would utilize this app. This will serve as a guide for what potential users will look for based on their background

### Prototype and Feedback
The finalized design was based on a direction of having a very clear onboarding process. Creating a painless onboarding process gave users more time to interact with the core application, which is the swipe/matching mechanism and the chat feature. Some feedback received based on this was the concern of showing the face may create bias towards the potential person you are presented with. However, other feedback relayed that there is merit in showing the faces of the people you match with, as the photo is a humanizing factor through a digital interface. This is an ongoing issue within tech and social media as a whole, and it is one of my aims to eventually come up with a better solution to this. However, due to time constraints this remained unchanged as it did not factor into a usability issue. The final app was built using React Native and the repo on Github is available below.
